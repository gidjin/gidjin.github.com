### Deciding to learn Clojure

It's been a while since I've written anything for the blog, and I've recently decided to give it another shot. I've also been learning scala and functional programming for a project at work and to better my skills I thought I would go through a Clojure guide to help cement the functional programming paradigm in my mind, and see how another language approaches it. So to meld the desire to write and the desire to learn I'm going to log my progress as I go through [Brave Clojure](http://www.braveclojure.com/) by Daniel Higginbotham.

## Chapter 1. Learning the REPL and Leiningen

First thing I will say is that Daniel has a wonderful writing style. He has made what many would consider boring fun, and not a way that comes across as forced or cheesy as I have seen in other tech books. For example the opening paragraph of the introduction:

  > Deep in your innermost being, you’ve always known you were destined to learn Clojure. Every time you held your keyboard aloft, crying out in anguish over an incomprehensible class hierarchy; every time you lay awake at night, disturbing your loved ones with sobs over a mutation-induced heisenbug; every time a race condition caused you to pull out more of your ever-dwindling hair, some secret part of you has known that there has to be a better way.

  > Now, at long last, the instructional material you have in front of your face will unite you with the programming language you’ve been longing for. [1]

Not only do I find myself resonating with it but it helps characterize the general tone of the book. After reading that, and the rest of the introduction, I'm looking forward to learning more.

First task is the standard hello world type program, to just print a line and ensure the install works. This was pretty straight forward. He even talks you through packaging a jar of your hello world app as an eample of how you could share it.

After that he takes you through the basic usage of the Clojure REPL, which having used both the Ruby and Scala REPLs before wasn't anything new for me. But still good to see and the book stays true to its purpose of explaining everything you need for Clojure just to cover your bases.

I'm looking forward to writing some more real code, and learning more. Though as a staunch Vim user I'm thinking I'll mostly skip chapter 2 on using Emacs.
