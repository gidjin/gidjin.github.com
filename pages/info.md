### Why Don't You Have Comments?

I am inclined to agree with what Matt Gemmell posted [on his site](http://mattgemmell.com/2011/11/29/comments-off/) Comments don't seem to add enough value for me to put up with dealing with spam and moderation. Feel free to post comments on twitter or on your blog etc.
